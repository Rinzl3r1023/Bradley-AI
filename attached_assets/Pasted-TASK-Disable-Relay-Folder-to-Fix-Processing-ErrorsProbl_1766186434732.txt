TASK: Disable Relay Folder to Fix Processing ErrorsProblem: The relay/ folder (containing node.py and __init__.py) may be auto-loading on startup and causing conflicts, since we're not using the node network for MVP. This could be causing the "Processing failed" errors.Solution: Rename the folder so Python doesn't try to import it.STEP 1: Rename the Relay FolderFind the folder named:

relay/ OR
Relay/
Rename it to:
relay_DISABLEDHow to do this:

Right-click the folder → Rename
Or use command in Shell: mv relay relay_DISABLED
STEP 2: Verify Folder is RenamedCheck that these exist:

✅ relay_DISABLED/node.py
✅ relay_DISABLED/__init__.py
Check that these DO NOT exist:

❌ relay/node.py
❌ relay/__init__.py
STEP 3: Delete Python Cache FilesClear any cached imports from relay folder:Run these commands in Shell:bashrm -rf __pycache__
rm -rf relay_DISABLED/__pycache__
rm -rf detection/__pycache__
rm -rf agents_DISABLED/__pycache__
find . -type d -name __pycache__ -exec rm -rf {} + 2>/dev/nullThis removes all compiled Python cache files that might still reference the old relay folder.STEP 4: Verify app.py Has StubsMake sure app.py still has the stub code (should be around line 279-295).Look for this section:python# Agents module disabled for MVP - using direct detection functions instead
# from relay.node import grid_node, get_registry_stats, add_lounge_node

# Create minimal stubs for backward compatibility
class GridNodeStub:
    node_id = "standalone-node-001"
    def get_status(self):
        return {"status": "standalone", "node_id": self.node_id}

grid_node = GridNodeStub()

def get_registry_stats():
    return {"total_nodes": 1, "active_nodes": 1}

def add_lounge_node(endpoint):
    return "stub-node-id"If this code exists ✅ → Perfect, continue to Step 5If this code is missing ❌ → Add it back to app.py around line 279 (before the SwarmStub class)STEP 5: Restart the ServerStop and restart the Replit server:

Click "Stop" button (or Ctrl+C in console)
Wait for complete shutdown (all processes stopped)
Click "Run" button
Wait for startup messages:

"Bradley AI online."
"Guardian program activated."
"=== BRADLEY AI GUARDIAN READY ==="


STEP 6: Verify No ErrorsWatch the console output during restart.Should see:

✅ "Bradley AI online."
✅ "=== BRADLEY AI CONFIGURATION ==="
✅ "=== BRADLEY AI GUARDIAN READY ==="
✅ No import errors
✅ No critical errors
Should NOT see:

❌ ImportError: cannot import name ... from 'relay'
❌ ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'relay'
❌ Any errors mentioning "relay" or "node"
WHY THIS FIXES IT:The relay folder was:

Potentially auto-loading on server startup
Trying to establish node connections that don't exist
May have been importing from agents folder (circular dependency)
Consuming resources needed for video detection
By renaming to relay_DISABLED, Python will no longer try to import those modules. The stub implementations in app.py provide the minimal compatibility needed for existing routes.WHAT HAPPENS NEXT:After restart:

Video detection API should process requests properly
No more relay/node import conflicts
Resources freed for actual video processing
Test should succeed (or reveal if model loading is the remaining issue)
