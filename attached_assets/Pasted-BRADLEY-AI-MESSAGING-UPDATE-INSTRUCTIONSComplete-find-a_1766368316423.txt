FIND: deepfake
REPLACE: AI-generated contentIMPORTANT: Do replacements in this EXACT order (most specific first)Manual Review Areas:Look for these sections and update manually if needed:Hero Section (Main headline):

Should say something like: "Detect AI-Generated Content Everywhere"
NOT: "Detect Deepfakes Everywhere"
Tagline/Subtitle:

Should say: "Real-time AI content verification"
NOT: "Real-time deepfake detection"
CTA Buttons:

FIND: deepfakes
REPLACE: AI-generated contentReplace 4:
FIND: deepfake
REPLACE: AI-generated contentManual Verification for FAQ Questions:Question 1:

Should be: "HOW DOES BRADLEY DETECT AI GENERATED CONTENT?"
Answer should mention: "AI models to analyze video content for signs of manipulation"
Question about accuracy:

Should be: "IS BRADLEY 100% ACCURATE?"
Answer should say: "No AI system is perfect" (this is fine, no deepfake mention needed)
STEP 6: UPDATE APP.PY (Backend Routes) 🔧File Location: app.pyInstructions:
Open app.py
Look for route comments or print statements
Find & Replace (if present):Replace 1:
FIND: # Deepfake detection endpoint
REPLACE: # AI content detection endpointReplace 2:
FIND: "Deepfake detection"
REPLACE: "AI content detection"Replace 3:
FIND: deepfake_detected
REPLACE: ai_generatedIMPORTANT: Only replace in COMMENTS and string literals

Do NOT change function names (breaking change)
Do NOT change variable names (breaking change)
ONLY change user-facing strings and comments
Example Safe Changes:python# OLD
# Route for deepfake detection
@app.route('/api/detect')
def detect_deepfake():
    # Perform deepfake analysis
    return {"deepfake_detected": True}

# NEW
# Route for AI content detection
@app.route('/api/detect')
def detect_deepfake():  # Function name stays same (no breaking change)
    # Perform AI content analysis
    return {"deepfake_detected": True}  # API response stays same (backward compatible)If you want to change API responses (breaking change), do it in Phase 2STEP 7: CREATE MESSAGING REFERENCE DOC 📖Create New File: MESSAGING.md (optional but recommended)In Replit, create this file in root directory:markdown# Bradley AI Messaging Guide

## Official Terminology

### Primary Language (Consumer-Facing)
- ✅ "AI-generated content" or "AI content"
- ✅ "AI content detection"
- ✅ "Video authenticity verification"
- ✅ "Human-created" vs "AI-generated"
- ❌ "Deepfake" (avoid in consumer-facing copy)
- ❌ "Fake video" (imprecise)
- ❌ "Synthetic media" (too technical)

### Badge Labels
- 🔴 Red Badge: "AI Generated" or "AI Content"
- 🟢 Green Badge: "Human Created" or "Authentic"
- 🟡 Yellow Badge: "Unknown" (honest uncertainty)

### Technical/Internal Language (Docs, API, Code)
- "Deepfake" acceptable in technical contexts
- Function names can retain "deepfake" (avoid breaking changes)
- API responses maintain compatibility

## Brand Voice
- Transparent, not alarmist
- Helpful, not fear-based
- Clear, not jargon-heavy
- Universal, not niche

## Updated: December 21, 2025Save this file - helps maintain consistency ✅STEP 8: VERIFICATION CHECKLIST ✅After Making All Changes:Run the app and check each page:
Homepage (/):

 No mention of "deepfake" in visible text
 Says "AI content" or "AI-generated content"
 Hero section updated
 Features section updated



Beta Page (/beta):

 No "deepfake" in visible text
 Updated to "AI content" language



Privacy Page (/privacy):

 "AI content analysis" (not deepfake analysis)
 Consistent terminology throughout



Support Page (/support):

 FAQ questions updated
 Answers use "AI content" language
 No "deepfake" except possibly in technical explanations



Search the Codebase:

bash   # In Replit Shell, search for remaining "deepfake" mentions
   grep -r "deepfake" templates/Review results - should only be:

Internal variable names (OK to keep)
API endpoints (OK to keep for now)
No user-facing text
STEP 9: BROWSER EXTENSION UPDATE (If Applicable) 🔌If You Have Extension Files in Replit:File Locations:

extension/popup.html
extension/popup.js
extension/manifest.json
extension/background.js
Updates Needed:manifest.json:
json{
  "name": "Bradley AI Guardian - AI Content Detector",
  "description": "Detects AI-generated content in videos across the web",
  ...
}popup.html / popup.js:

Update badge text from "Deepfake Detected" → "AI Generated"
Update UI labels from "deepfake" → "AI content"
I can provide specific extension code updates if needed - let me know!STEP 10: FINAL QUALITY CHECK 🎯In Replit Shell, Run These Commands:bash# Search for any remaining "deepfake" in templates
echo "=== Checking templates folder ==="
grep -ri "deepfake" templates/ || echo "✅ No deepfake mentions in templates"

# Search for user-facing strings in app.py
echo "=== Checking app.py for user-facing strings ==="
grep -i "deepfake" app.py | grep -E "(print|return.*[\'\"])" || echo "✅ No deepfake in user-facing strings"

# Count total mentions (including code/comments)
echo "=== Total deepfake mentions (including code) ==="
grep -ri "deepfake" . --exclude-dir=templates_backup_deepfake --exclude-dir=static_backup_deepfake | wc -lExpected results:

✅ Zero mentions in templates (user-facing)
⚠️ Some mentions in code (function names, variables - OK to keep)
✅ Backups excluded from search
ROLLBACK INSTRUCTIONS ⏪If You Need to Revert:bash# Restore all templates
rm -rf templates
cp -r templates_backup_deepfake templates

# Restore static files
rm -rf static
cp -r static_backup_deepfake static

# Restart app
# (Click "Run" button in Replit)Then refresh browser - old messaging restored ✅ESTIMATED TIME ⏱️Per File:

Homepage: 5-10 minutes
Beta page: 2-3 minutes
Privacy page: 2-3 minutes
Support page: 3-5 minutes
App.py review: 3-5 minutes
Verification: 5 minutes
Total: ~25-35 minutes for complete update ✅QUICK REFERENCE: FIND & REPLACE PRIORITY 📝Do These In Order (Most Specific → Least Specific):
"Deepfake Detection" → "AI Content Detection"
"deepfake detection" → "AI content detection"
"Detect Deepfakes" → "Detect AI Generated Content"
"deepfake analysis" → "AI content analysis"
"deepfake scanner" → "AI content scanner"
"deepfakes" → "AI-generated content"
"Deepfake" → "AI Content"
"deepfake" → "AI-generated content"
Why this order? Prevents partial replacements (e.g., replacing "deepfake" first would break "deepfake detection" into "AI-generated content detection")COMMONLY MISSED SPOTS 🔍Check These Manually:
